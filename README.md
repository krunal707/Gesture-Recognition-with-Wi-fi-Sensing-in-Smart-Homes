Gesture-Recognition-with-Wi-fi-Sensing-in-Smart-Homes

This project aims to develop a system for determining human movement by capturing their movements using existing wifi-signals.
The data for human movements are captured using Channel State Information from Wi-Fi enabled devices and then feed to a machine learning algorithm to detect the type of movement.
Then the Machine Learning algorithm uses an artificial neural network called Autoencoder and Softmax training to predict the output.
This project aims at developing a system that can authenticate the user through its daily activities and without any need of external devices.
